        <strong>Covid-19 quarantine related</strong>
        <p>All our guides have been vaccinated. Guests, guides and drivers will be checked for body temperature every day.
        </p>

        <strong>Covid-19 Cancellation Protection</strong>
        <p>You must notify us of your need to cancel for a Covid-19 reason as early as possible (and at the latest 24 hours before
        your scheduled departure), and must provide us with appropriate written official evidence of the Covid-19 reason.
        
        Your Travel Insurance may cover the cost of your lost holiday and we will ask you to contact your insurer in the first
        instance.
        
        If your insurer will not allow the cost of your lost holiday as part of your claim, we will transfer your full booking
        value to a future booking or hold it in credit for you. Please note that for us to do this, evidence must be provided.
        If you have what you believe to be Covid-19 symptoms, you must arrange and take a test as soon as possible. We may also
        ask for evidence of your refused insurance claim.
        
        We reserve the right to refuse to allow you to transfer your booking where we are not reasonably satisfied that you are
        cancelling for a Covid-19 reason. In such circumstances normal cancellation terms will apply.
        
        Your Covid-19 reason must prevent you safely joining your scheduled departure and will take into account current
        applicable UK Government, your nationality’s government and/or destination government coronavirus guidance.
        
        For the purposes of these terms a “Covid-19 reason” is either a confirmed diagnosis of Covid-19 within 30 days prior to
        departure or an order, via the NHS’s track & trace team, to self-isolate due to contact with a person who has, or may
        have, Covid-19.</p>
        <br>

        <strong>Cancelation Policy</strong>
        <p>Cancellation of a booking must be made in written form, by sending us cancellation email or messages. We will not
        regard
        a booking as canceled unless and until written notice is received by us. On cancellation the following charges will
        apply
        <p><strong>Days prior to trip / Percentage of trip refund</strong></p>
        <p>Over 43 Days / 100%</p>
        <p>42-15 Days / 70%</p>
