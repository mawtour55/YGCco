        <h3>6 Days Seoul, Nami, Ski resort</h3>
        <h5>Tour guide: Mr.Stephan</h5>
        <h5>Customer: Singaporean actress MASTURA AHMAD</h5>
        <p>The trip was planned last minute which include an elderly. Once
        I touched base with Nell, he make it easy and accommodate a few
        changes in our itinerary. Stephan, our tour excellent tour guide, was
        very prompt and knowledgeable.
        My kids had fun snowboarding in the ski-resort and shopping in the
        old and new shopping districts. Our trip include food and and
        a comfortable van for the whole trip.
        The only downside was the seafood lunch trip... it cost a bomb to
        buy and cooked. Always asked before buying.
        I will definitely recommend YGC</p>

        <h5>Tour guide: Mr.Kevin</h5>
        <h5>Customer: Peter tang</h5>
        <p>6 adults and 4 kids had a wonderful vacation in Yongpyong SKi Resort and Seoul in early Dec 2019, made possible through the prompt and attentive responses from Nell Kim of YGC Korea Travel. I just had to indicate my prererences and Nell came back with an itinerary that showed he understood my requests and within my budget. The local guide was very helpful
        and caring about our safety, especially for the children and made sure that they were properly clothed because of the freezing temperatures. Nell also joined us on one of the days to extend his hospitality. YGC is a great Korean travel planner to help make your trip a pleasant adventure.</p>

        <h3>8 Days Seoul, Jeju, Busan </h3>
        <h5>Tour guide: Mr.Michael</h5>
        <h5>Customer: Elsie Chew</h5>
        <p>We are a group of 4 travelling to South Korea to relax, enjoy the fabulous food and the cool climate as compared to where we came from. We were not disappointed. We had a good time because of the great teamwork provided by Nell n his team of local guides from places we visited namely Michael from Seoul, Mr. Bek from Jeju and Hayden from Busan. The guides were fantastic, professional, helpful and know their locales well,always trying their best to meet our needs.
        Special mention must be given to Nell who apologised sincerely when there was a screw up in the hotel accommodation. This is one quality that I don't see much in many travel agents who screwed up least of all admitted their mistake. We
        are always grateful to them for making our stay a memorable one. We wish all of them well and hope to catch up with them again whenever any of them visit my country. We highly recommend his services for people who want to know more about South Korea and it's wonderful people.</p>

            <p>First of all, we would like to appreciate the planning of our 12 days 11 nights itinerary by Patricia. She was always prompt in response my email and helpful. And we received welcoming gifts from YGC! We are families with young children aged between 7 to 10. Patricia provided us a good accommodation, delicious food and customised trip planning for us. We enjoyed our trip without worrying anything with the help of 3 experienced tour guides during our trip to Jeju, Busan and Seoul. All of our tour guides were always very helpful and very patient to wait for us. We would strongly recommend YGC to family travel with young children! Their price are very reasonable and they always attend to your question promptly. Thank you YGC and we will meet again when our next trip to Korea! Thank you very much!</p>
